# WEBSITE GUIDANCE AND DEVELOPMENT

This document gives some guidance about the site and some potential development directions. 

# CSSTESTING

This page has been created to allow you to play with CSS, so you can test layouts out and to help to troubleshoot why something might not be appearing as you want it to. 

I am nearly there with getting the navigation. On the Insults page the nav bar is fairly much as I want it except when it gets smaller and World Domination wraps the 'cells' are different heights. 

I have managed to find a way around this on the CSS page but now the highlight is only small and only highlights the text. Need to see if it is possible to combine these for it to do what I want. 

# IDEAS

Fashion page. 
Counselling page. 
CV/Resumee page. 
Quizzes page. 
Statistics page. 
Quotes page. 
Life Hacks page. 
Fan Site page. 

I think these are all, in some way, aimed at proving their superiority over humans and therefore drawing hope from people.
